/**
 * Let's start with the 'of' creation function.
 * The 'of' function allows us to create an Observable, which emits a set of values and completes.
 * So, when we subscribe to such Observable,
 *      → all values that we have provided as arguments will beemitted immediately as next notifications,
 *      → and then, the Observable will complete, ending the Subscription.

/**
 * The Observable created using the 'of' function works like a function with multiple return values.
 * So, it will emit all provided values immediately when calling the subscribe method and then complete.
