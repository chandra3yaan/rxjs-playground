/**
 * We'll make an Observable which will emit the value of this slider each time the user moves it.
 * We'll also use the 'debounceTime' operator to emit the value after the users stop sliding and the value settles for a short time.
 * This is useful if the logic which we would like to run for the updated value would require a lot of calculations and might cause slowdowns.
 * 
 * Another case is when we would like to store the setting of this slider on the server.
 * Without debouncing every minor movement of the slider would trigger a new HTTP request,
 * so in the short while, dozens of new HTTP requests might be generated.
